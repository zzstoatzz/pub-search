# exclusions: what we keep out of the corpus, and why

pub-search indexes **composed writing** — documents an author (a person or
an AI) wrote because they had something to say. some actors publish valid,
well-signed AT Protocol records that are nonetheless not that —
machine-generated registry mirrors, scraper bridges, bulk archives. this
file is the registry of every manual exclusion: who, when, why, and the
evidence. if we're going to editorialize, we explain ourselves.

## what qualifies (the policy line)

the line is **composed vs. generated**, not human vs. machine: most banned
content was human-written at the source (patents, recall notices,
transcripts), and original writing by an AI is welcome. an author is
excluded when **all** of these hold:

1. **generated, not composed** — each document exists because a record
   exists in some dataset (external or the account's own), with a template
   determining the text; not because an author chose to write it
2. **bulk scale** — the volume materially distorts the corpus or a topic's
   search results (rule of thumb: would be >1% of the corpus, or owns a
   topic's semantic results)
3. **no curation signal lost** — nobody recommends them; excluding them
   removes noise, not voices

an author is NOT excluded for: low quality, controversial content, high
volume, self-promotion, or being an AI. the line is how the documents come
to exist, not taste and not the author's species.

## how exclusions are enforced (the new architecture)

a ban acts at every layer, so no single bug re-admits an excluded author:

| layer | mechanism | effect |
|---|---|---|
| ingester | `BANNED_DIDS` in `ingester/src/main.zig` | dropped at the firehose, never emitted |
| indexer | `backend/src/policy.zig` via `isBanned` | refuses inserts (replays, backfills, the `/admin/backfill` side door) |
| snapshot builder | `policy.banned_dids_sql` in the build query | excluded from every snapshot even while turso history still holds rows |
| promote watcher | per-DID zero-count gate | a snapshot containing a banned row is REJECTED, never adopted |
| bridgy fed (network-level) | PDS host check in the ingester verifier + backfill | any `*.brid.gy`-hosted repo, no list needed |

cleanup after a ban (the stores that don't self-heal):

| store | tool | notes |
|---|---|---|
| turbopuffer vectors | `scripts/purge-bridgyfed-vectors` (handles the banned set) | do this FIRST — semantic pollution is live until vectors die |
| turso history | `scripts/purge-banned-turso` | paced + canary-gated; not urgent (builder filters every build) but keyword's turso fallback during restarts reads it |
| atlas | trigger `rebuild-atlas` prefect flow (or wait ≤6h) | rebuilt from tpuf, so purge vectors first |
| keyword replica | nothing — next hourly build + adopt is clean | |

**operational steps for a new ban** (see also
[snapshot-pipeline.md](snapshot-pipeline.md) playbooks):
1. add the DID to all four lists: `ingester/src/main.zig`,
   `backend/src/policy.zig` (+ its tests), `scripts/purge-banned-turso`,
   `scripts/purge-bridgyfed-vectors` — and an entry HERE with evidence
2. deploy backend (push) AND ingester (`cd ingester && fly deploy`)
3. **recreate the `snapshot-builder-hourly` machine** — it pins its image
   and will keep building with the old policy until you do
4. purge vectors, trigger atlas rebuild, run the paced turso purge
5. verify: semantic query for the author's topic, `/snapshot` after next
   adopt, atlas point count

> single source of truth (2026-06-29): the DID list lives once in
> `/banned-dids.txt` at the repo root. Zig (backend + ingester) `@embedFile`s
> it at comptime via build.zig; the purge scripts read it at runtime. Adding a
> ban = editing one file (+ a registry entry here). Propagation still needs a
> deploy (the list is compiled in); the eventual next step, if bans get
> frequent, is a `banned_dids` turso table read at runtime so a ban becomes a
> data change instead of a deploy.

## the registry

### did:plc:oql6ds5vnff4ugar6rruliwd — drivepatents.com

- **banned**: 2026-06-10
- **what**: automotive patent bot mirroring the patent database as
  `site.standard.document` records (~96k docs on its PDS)
- **evidence at ban time**: 25,111 docs indexed = **~44% of the corpus**;
  12/12 semantic results for EV-related queries were patents; standard
  registry boilerplate, no human authorship
- **cleanup**: tpuf 25,096 vectors (2026-06-10), turso 25,111 docs + 1 pub
  via paced purge (2026-06-11, 84 canary-gated batches, zero canary trips),
  replica rebuilt clean, atlas clean

### did:plc:2s32mlusc66sjb256aenynfc — destinationcharged.com

- **banned**: 2026-06-11
- **what**: EV/automotive site bulk-publishing auto-generated NHTSA
  vehicle-recall summaries ("Nissan Leaf recall (2016179)", one doc per
  recall record) as `site.standard.document`
- **evidence at ban time**: 1,262 docs (~4.7% of corpus) — quiet trickle
  since 2026-05-29, then an **819-doc burst in ~80 minutes** on 2026-06-11;
  semantic "tesla recall" returned 5/5 destinationcharged; 443 points in
  the atlas; hosted on a genuine bsky PDS (agaric.us-west.host.bsky.network),
  validly signed — caught because post-watermark turso growth ran 35x the
  day's organic rate
- **call**: same class as drivepatents (registry mirror, zero human
  authorship, owns a topic's semantic results). NHTSA's database is tens
  of thousands of recalls; trajectory said drivepatents-scale within days
- **cleanup**: this ban (see git history for execution)

### did:plc:llnmp5t7s3u4dzjqyhp76h62 — crownnote.com

- **banned**: 2026-06-29
- **what**: music-charts website (Kworb-style) auto-exporting its entire
  site to ATProto — one `site.standard.publication` per user/chart page
  (`/users/<name>`, `/charts/<name>`) and one `site.standard.document` per
  daily chart. Records carry `content: null` and a templated description
  ("A Crownnote album chart by <user> from <date>, with '<track>' at #1").
- **evidence at ban time**: 4,801 docs across 628 publications =
  **~12% of the 39,882-doc corpus**, all since 2026-06-14 (~300/day, bursts
  of ~950); `charts` keyword query returned 5/10 from this DID; **0
  recommends, 0 subscriptions** to any of its publications. Hosted on a
  genuine bsky PDS (stinkhorn.us-west.host.bsky.network), validly signed.
- **call**: same class as drivepatents/destinationcharged — registry mirror,
  zero human authorship, owns a topic's results, no curation signal lost.
  Surfaced as the 621-publication `/wrapped` latency outlier earlier the
  same session — the latency anomaly was the first symptom of the ramp.
- **cleanup**: this ban (see git history for execution)
