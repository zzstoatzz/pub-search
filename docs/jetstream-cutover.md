# jetstream ingest cutover

The backend consumes verified Jetstream V2 events directly. This replaced the
`leaflet-search-ingester` Fly app, which was deleted on August 17, 2026.

## why this preserves verification

A Jetstream consumer cannot re-verify commits itself — the commit and MST
blocks are not on the wire. But every host in our list runs full Sync 1.1
signature/MST verification at *its own* ingest and withholds unverified data:

- **stream.waow.tech** (primary): `verify.zig` — "no event is served or
  archived unverified when the DID resolves"; failed signatures dropped,
  chain gaps trigger authenticated whole-repo repair.
- **Bluesky's hosted Jetstream V2 instances** (fallback): offline Sync 1.1
  signature verification in the production live path; `#sync` divergence
  resyncs through the sync verifier (bluesky-social/jetstream
  `specs/oracle.md`, `docs/README.md`).

Verification moves one hop upstream; the trust step is operator trust of
verifying implementations. Jetstream **v1** instances do NOT verify — never
add one as a fallback host.

## how it works (`backend/src/ingest/jetstream.zig`)

- The zat.dev/jetstream unified client sweeps the archive from `after_seq`,
  then performs a sequence-deduplicated cutover to the live event stream.
  Expired cursors re-enter archive recovery. Events enter `dispatchRecord`.
- At-least-once: synchronous dispatch completes before the durable sequence
  cursor at `/data/jetstream-cursor` is persisted, with a two-second time gate.
  Restarts resume from that sequence; idempotent upserts absorb redelivery.
  Legacy `time_us` cursors are converted through archive metadata on startup.
- Policy parity in-process: banned DIDs via `policy.isBanned`; bridgy fed
  via a cached DID→PDS check (`ingester.resolvePds` + `isBridgyPds`).
  Resolution failure admits the event (bridgy repos are did:plc and resolve
  reliably; the reconciler re-checks PDS hosting later).
- Staleness watchdog at 15 min (`JETSTREAM_STALE_SECS`) — our collections
  are quiet, a firehose-style 90s watchdog would false-trigger.
- Env: `JETSTREAM_HOSTS` (CSV override), `JETSTREAM_CURSOR_PATH`, and
  `JETSTREAM_API_KEY`. Without the key, archive recovery is unavailable and
  recovery degrades to the live replay window. Only stream.waow.tech is enabled
  by default; adding a host requires deliberate verification and credential setup.

## rollout (completed)

1. 2026-08-16 02:59Z — cutover to a zat v1 jetstream client behind
   `INGEST_SOURCE`. Same-night incident: unbounded PLC fetch stalled the
   read loop (fixed: detached-thread resolve deadline).
2. 2026-08-17 04:08Z — transport migrated to the zat.dev/jetstream SDK's
   unified `subscribe` (seq cursors, archive sweep, gapless recovery);
   persisted v1 time_us cursor auto-converted via `fetchAnchor`.
3. 2026-08-17 — after ~25h of clean soak: `leaflet-search-ingester` fly app
   + volume destroyed, `ingester/` deleted, `INGEST_SOURCE` switch removed
   (jetstream is the only live-ingest path).
