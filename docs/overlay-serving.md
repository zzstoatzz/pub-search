# overlay serving: live freshness beside the frozen snapshot

*shipped 2026-08-13. the serving stack is now: CF edge cache → snapshot + live
overlay merge (fly `app`) → background tenants (fly `worker`) → offline builder
(heavypad). this is typeahead's architecture ported to document search.*

## the problem it solved

the local replica is frozen by construction (in-place sync deleted 2026-06-26
after the persist-format outage). before the overlay, its ONLY freshness
mechanism was adopting a complete new ~800MB snapshot every 2h — which
replaced every byte of the serving file (100% page-cache eviction), saturated
the 1GB machine during download/verify, and coupled freshness to a heavyweight
operation. measured cost: first-query-after-idle 0.6–2s chronically; 5–58s
during adoption + backlog windows; a fresh document was invisible to search
for up to 2 hours.

## the design

- **`/data/overlay.db`** (`backend/src/db/OverlayDb.zig`): a small persistent
  SQLite file that survives adoptions. holds `documents_overlay` (full result
  projection per doc), `overlay_fts` (fts5, **same unicode61 tokenizer as the
  snapshot** — divergence serves wrong results with no error), tags, and
  tombstones (`deleted=1`).
- **write path**: the ingest worker projects every document upsert/delete into
  the overlay AFTER the turso batch commits (`ingest/indexer.zig`).
  at-least-once + idempotent; overlay failure logs + counts, never fails
  ingest. a lost write is healed by the next snapshot — the overlay is a
  freshness cache, never a source of truth.
- **read path** (`server/search.zig`): keyword and tag queries run the
  snapshot query and a capped overlay query (`OVERLAY_HIT_CAP`), computing the
  IDENTICAL score expression (`bm25 rank + days_old/30`) per source, then
  merge in Zig: overlay wins on uri collision, tombstones suppress snapshot
  hits, and the merged stream feeds the existing dedup/visibility gates so
  the response shape is unchanged. semantic/hybrid hydration
  (`fetchLocalExtras`, `isBridgyFed`) reads overlay-first.
  - bm25 across two FTS tables is not one scale in general; it works here
    because ranking is recency-dominant and overlay rows are at most one
    build-cadence old. verified empirically at cutover (A/B parity on 4
    surfaces; the positive case: a doc indexed post-snapshot was a miss with
    `overlay=0` and a HIT with `overlay=1`).
- **compaction**: the promote watcher, after a successful adoption, deletes
  overlay rows with `indexed_at <=` the adopted manifest's `source_watermark`
  (adopt-then-compact — the crash-safe order; a crash before compaction
  leaves shadowed-but-correct rows for the next cycle). the builder also
  stamps `sync_meta('source_watermark')` into the snapshot itself.
- **bounds**: `MAX_OVERLAY_ROWS` (default 50k) sheds oldest under backfill
  floods (amortized check every 512 upserts). overlay size is
  ingest_rate × snapshot_cadence — corpus-independent.

flags: `OVERLAY_WRITE=1` (projection), `OVERLAY_SERVE=1` (merge), both live in
`backend/fly.toml`. per-request `?overlay=0/1` overrides serving for A/B.
`/admin/overlay/status` exposes rows/tombstones/watermark + recent uris.

## what it unlocks

snapshot cadence is now decoupled from freshness: docs are searchable within
~a minute of publish regardless of when the builder last ran. the prefect
cadence (`40 */2` on `pub-search-snapshot`) can stretch to 6h/24h (Stage 4,
pending soak data) — which is what makes 10x corpus cheap: builder export is
linear but offline, adoption is rare, and no request path does
corpus-proportional work.

## the bounded candidate pass (same day)

common words made the keyword candidate pass corpus-proportional ("what"
matched 24.6k of 71k docs → one covering-index probe per match → 7–14s).
unfiltered queries now rank all matches by bm25 INSIDE the fts index
(posting-list scan, no table probes), and only the top
`CANDIDATE_PREFILTER_K` (2000) get covering-index probes for the
recency+policy re-rank. measured: candidate pass 0.229s → 0.088s warm; cold
"what" 7.4s → 0.7s. trade: recency promotes only within the bm25 top-K on
unfiltered queries (author/since/platform keep the exhaustive shape). the
results this displaced for "what" were <1-day-old docs with bm25 ≈ -1.1 —
barely-relevant mentions that recency had rescued.

## process isolation + edge (same day)

- **fly process groups** (`backend/fly.toml`, plyr.fm's pattern):
  `app` = HTTP + ingest + labeler + promote (everything touching `/data`);
  `worker` = reconciler + embedder (stateless; turso/voyage/tpuf only) on its
  own 512MB machine. background storms (PDS-timeout bursts, embedding
  batches, a review loop hot-failing on a delisted cocore model) can no
  longer share a vCPU with search — the cause of a 14s query on 2026-08-13.
  `PROCESS_ROLE` env selects the role; unset runs everything (dev unchanged).
  **the worker group must stay at exactly one machine** (single embedder
  writer against turso DiskANN).
- **CF edge cache** (`site/functions/api/[[route]].js`): the frontend calls
  same-origin `/api/*`; GET `/search` is cached at the edge 60s with 10min
  stale-while-revalidate. repeated queries answer in ~10-30ms without
  touching fly; backend blips serve stale. `/admin` is never proxied;
  `?edge=0` bypasses per-request; rollback is reverting the frontend to the
  fly URL (which still serves directly).

## fleet freshness check

`GET /health/freshness` returns 503 when the local serving replica is not ready,
its `leaflet` FTS sentinel has no match, the enabled overlay cannot be queried,
the durable ingest cursor is missing or older than `JETSTREAM_STALE_SECS`
(default 900 seconds), or a snapshot adoption window closed without a recent
enough build. `/health` remains process liveness.

The snapshot timestamp comes from `sync_meta.last_sync` in the serving database
(the builder stamps the same timestamp into its manifest). The adoption policy
uses `PROMOTE_ADOPT_UTC_HOURS`, skips the current open window, and allows the
existing watchdog's 150-minute builder-cadence margin. Unwindowed adoption has
the watchdog's 180-minute limit. Invalid timestamps or adoption hours fail the
check. No new documents is not a failure: ingest progress follows the durable
cursor, which also advances on the subscription's identity/account events.

Responses are uncached aggregate evidence, without document contents or secrets.
The probe does not mutate state or restart processes. The external ingestion
watchdog remains independent and retains its source-of-truth and builder checks.
