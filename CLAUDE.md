# pub-search notes

## deployment
- **backend**: push to `main` touching `backend/**` → auto-deploys via GitHub Actions
- **frontend**: manual deploy via `site/deploy.sh` — regenerates the workbox service worker (precache manifest embeds content hashes) then runs wrangler with `--branch=main`. Don't call wrangler directly or returning visitors get stale precached assets.
  - ⚠️ `deploy.sh` ships whatever atlas datasets are on disk (likely stale) — **always pull the live ones first**: `for f in atlas.json.gz atlas-mini.json atlas-avatar-cache.json atlas-theme-cache.json atlas-summaries.json atlas-summaries-lite.json; do curl -sfo site/$f https://pub-search.waow.tech/$f; done`. Otherwise you regress prod atlas data until the next 6h `leaflet-atlas` prefect rebuild. (`/atlas.json` no longer exists on prod — the SPA serves a fake-200 HTML page for it; the dataset is `atlas.json.gz`.)
- `--app` does NOT protect against deploying from the wrong directory — it only renames the target; the config (ports, env, mounts) still comes from that directory's `fly.toml`. Always `cd` into the app dir first. (2026-06-10: a root-dir deploy was stopped only by a volume-name mismatch.)

## remotes
- `origin`: tangled.sh:zzstoatzz.io/pub-search
- `github`: github.com/zzstoatzz/pub-search (CI runs here)
- push to both: `git push origin main && git push github main`

## architecture
- **backend** (Zig): HTTP API, FTS5 search, vector similarity; same binary runs as the snapshot builder under `BUILDER_MODE=1`. Two fly process groups from one binary via `PROCESS_ROLE` (unset = everything, for dev): `app` = HTTP + ingest + labeler + promote (owns `/data`); `worker` = reconciler + embedder (stateless, 512MB) — ⚠️ worker MUST stay at exactly 1 machine (single embedder writer), and `fly scale count` may keep a stopped standby while destroying the running one — check `fly machine list` state after scaling
- **overlay** (`/data/overlay.db`): live freshness beside the frozen replica — ingest projects every doc upsert/delete after the turso commit; keyword/tag serving merges snapshot + overlay (overlay wins on uri, tombstones suppress); promote compacts to the adopted `source_watermark`. Flags `OVERLAY_WRITE`/`OVERLAY_SERVE` (both `1` in fly.toml); `?overlay=0/1` per-request; `/admin/overlay/status` for verification. See docs/overlay-serving.md
- **edge**: the frontend AND the MCP server call same-origin `/api/*` (Pages function `site/functions/api/[[route]].js`) — 10min edge cache + 30min stale-while-revalidate on GET /search, ETag revalidation against the origin (304 = zero search work); `?edge=0` bypasses; `/admin` never proxied; the fly hostname still serves directly (rollback path). Zone WAF rate limit: 30 req/10s per IP on `/api/*` → 429. See docs/scaling-economics.md
- **origin memo**: `/search` responses carry an ETag = (snapshot adoption generation, 5min bucket) and are memoized origin-side per URL (`backend/src/server/memo.zig`) — repeat queries cost a map lookup; hybrid pagination caps at 75 (fusion depth)
- **ingest**: `backend/src/ingest/jetstream.zig` consumes stream.waow.tech via the zat.dev/jetstream SDK (archive sweep + gapless live cutover, seq cursor at `/data/jetstream-cursor`, `JETSTREAM_API_KEY` secret); verification happens at stream's ingest (Sync 1.1 sig+MST), banned/bridgy policy in-process — see docs/jetstream-cutover.md. (History: indigo Tap → own verified `/channel` ingester fly app → jetstream; the fly app was destroyed 2026-08-17.)
- **site**: static frontend on Cloudflare Pages
- **db**: Turso (source of truth) + local SQLite read replica (FTS queries; FROZEN by construction — in-place sync deleted 2026-06-26 — refreshed only by snapshot adoption, see docs/scaling-plan.md)
- **R2**: `leaflet-search-index` bucket for builder snapshots (`INDEX_R2_*` secrets on the backend app)

## platforms
- leaflet, pckt, offprint, greengale, whitewind, lemma: known platforms
- leaflet/pckt/offprint/greengale/lemma detected via basePath; whitewind via `com.whtwnd.*` collection
- other: site.standard.* documents not from a known platform

## search ranking
- hybrid BM25 + recency: `ORDER BY rank + (days_old / 30)`
- unfiltered keyword queries take a bounded candidate pass: bm25 top-`CANDIDATE_PREFILTER_K` (2000) inside the FTS index first, covering-index probes only for that set (common words were corpus-proportional — "what" = 24.6k matches = 7-14s before). Author/since/platform-filtered queries keep the exhaustive shape
- OR between terms for recall, prefix on the last word when it has 3+ letters
- **one MATCH per keyword statement.** snippets come from the document text in Zig (`snippetFromContent`), never from FTS5's `snippet()` in an outer query: `MATCH ? AND rowid IN (...)` is a second full scan (docs/retro-2026-09-05-keyword-second-match-scan.md)
- unicode61 tokenizer (non-alphanumeric = separator)
- tag queries: served from the local replica. Browse (empty query + tag) ranks by `months_old - RECOMMEND_LIFT·ln(1+recommenders)`; text within a tag ranks by the standard BM25 + recency

## snapshot builder (replica freshness)
- runs OFF fly since 2026-07-25: prefect deployment `pub-search-snapshot` on heavypad (`my-prefect-server/flows/pub_search_snapshot.py`), every 2h — see `docs/builder-offbox-plan.md`
- trigger a build now: `prefect deployment run 'pub-search-snapshot/pub-search-snapshot' --watch` (against prefect-server.waow.tech, tailnet)
- channels: `staging` (default) → `staging/builds/…` + `latest.staging.json`; `prod` requires `BUILDER_ALLOW_PROD=1` and writes `builds/…` + `latest.json` (pointer uploaded LAST)
- gates before publish: doc-count tolerance vs turso, FTS sentinel, quick_check; banned DIDs + bridgy rows excluded at build time (`policy.zig`)
- completion signal: `builder: published <id> to <channel> channel` in the flow-run logs; fly promote watcher adopts within its 5-min poll

## zig dependencies
- update a dependency hash: `zig fetch --save <url>` (fetches and updates build.zig.zon automatically)

## schema migrations
- run via [zug](https://tangled.sh/@zzstoatzz.io/zug) — see `docs/migrations.md`
- list lives in `backend/src/db/migrations.zig`
- to add: append a new entry with the next 3-digit prefix; **never edit existing migrations** (zug checksums them)
- `BOOTSTRAP_BASELINE_COUNT` is FROZEN at 10 — don't change it when adding new migrations
- repair a dirty migration: fix the underlying issue, then `UPDATE zug_migrations SET dirty=0 WHERE id='...'` and redeploy

## MCP server
- hosted: `claude mcp add-json pub-search '{"type": "http", "url": "https://pub-search-by-zzstoatzz.fastmcp.app/mcp"}'`
- local dev: `cd pub-search-mcp/server && uv run pytest` for tests
- the installable project lives in `pub-search-mcp/server/` — nested intentionally to work around a horizon (fastmcp.app's builder) bug where single-segment pyproject paths render as bare-name PyPI lookups instead of path installs (see prefecthq/horizon#3814). Remove the `server/` nesting once that PR lands.
- deployed on fastmcp.app

## labeler judge
- the classifier's model-pass reads `REVIEW_PROVIDER` (`openai`, default, or `anthropic`), `REVIEW_MODEL`, `REVIEW_API_URL`, `REVIEW_API_KEY` from fly secrets. defaults: OpenAI `gpt-5.6-luna` at api.openai.com; `REVIEW_PROVIDER=anthropic` switches to `claude-haiku-4-5` (both scored 9/9 on judge-eval, 2026-09-04). re-evaluate a candidate judge with `scripts/judge-eval <model>` before changing it; it must get every known account right on a majority of votes
- who reaches the judge: the title heuristic (`score` ≥ THRESHOLD), extreme volume (≥5000 docs), or **velocity** — at the 50-doc floor and every 25 after, an author whose documents per day over their date span is ≥2 is nominated regardless of score (fluent long-form farms score ~0.05). a human backfilling an old blog looks the same, costs one review, and then stays decided. **a rescore never drops a decided author**: LABELED/REJECTED/VETOED rows keep their verdict and only their counters are rebuilt, because serving filters on `author_stats` live (docs/retro-2026-09-05-rescore-label-spill.md)
- reviews are budgeted: `REVIEW_DAILY_BUDGET` (default 10) authors per UTC day, tracked in `classifier_meta` so a restart does not reset it; nominations past the budget stay PENDING and are picked up on later days
