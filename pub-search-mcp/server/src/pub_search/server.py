# pub-search MCP

search long-form writing on ATProto: leaflet, pckt, offprint, greengale, whitewind.

## tools

- `search(query, tag, platform, since, author)` - hybrid by default; narrow with filters rather than paging. every result carries `source` (keyword | semantic | keyword+semantic), a `snippet`, and `contentLength`
- `get_document(uri)` - the LIVE record from the author's PDS, flattened to text
- `author_profile(author)` - what one author writes, where, and over what period
- `find_similar(uri)` - documents near this one
- `describe_cluster(uri)` - that neighborhood plus cross-platform / author / shared-term observations
- `discover_focal_post(window, sort)` - what's notable right now
- `recommended_by_top_authors(top_authors, window)` - transitive taste: what the most-recommended writers themselves recommend

## resources

reference data, read when you need it, not carried in every turn:
`pub-search://stats`, `pub-search://tags`, `pub-search://popular`

## workflows

**research a topic.**
1. `search("topic")` — hybrid already, no mode to pick
2. `get_document(uri)` for the full current text
3. `describe_cluster(uri)` for who else is in this conversation

**curate / write about the network.** pub-search is the only place that sees
every long-form ATProto platform as one corpus, so the network-position of a
post (who else is writing about this, on which platforms) is information you
can't get from any single platform's UI.
1. `discover_focal_post(window="week", sort="trending")` to find what's hot
2. `describe_cluster(focal.uri)` to see the neighborhood + cross-platform observations
3. `get_document(focal.uri)` if you want the actual claim from inside the post

## search modes

`hybrid` is the default and is usually right. `keyword` for exact lookups;
`semantic` for purely conceptual questions. every filter binds in every
mode. Results carry a `source` field showing how each was found:
`keyword` (an FTS match), `semantic` (an embedding neighbour), or
`keyword+semantic` (both — the strongest signal in hybrid).

## snippets

every tool's results carry a `snippet`: the window around the match for a
search, otherwise the document's opening. `contentLength` is the indexed
text's length; a few hundred characters is a linkblog stub (a pull-quote
indexed as the whole document), not primary writing. triage
from the snippet; call `get_document` only for the ones you will read.

There is no `offset`: semantic ranking is approximate-nearest-neighbour and
does not repeat exactly, so page 2 is not a stable continuation of page 1.
Narrow the query instead.

## visibility

publications that set `preferences.showInDiscover=false` are indexed but kept
out of `search` and `find_similar`. their author asked to stay out of discovery.
`search(..., include_undiscoverable=True)` opts back in — use it when someone is
deliberately reading through a specific author's own writing, and pair it with
`author=`. do not set it on a general/global query.

## result types

- **article**: document in a publication
- **looseleaf**: standalone document
- **publication**: the publication itself

results include a `url` field for web access.
