# pub-search MCP

search long-form writing on ATProto: leaflet, pckt, offprint, greengale, whitewind.

## tools

- `search(query, mode, tag, platform, since, author)` - search with mode: keyword, semantic, or hybrid
- `get_document(uri)` - fetch full content by AT-URI
- `find_similar(uri)` - find related documents (raw)
- `discover_focal_post(window, sort)` - what's notable right now (top/trending in a window)
- `describe_cluster(uri)` - a focal post's neighborhood + cross-platform / author / shared-terms observations
- `recommended_by_top_authors(top_authors, window)` - transitive taste: what the most-recommended writers are themselves recommending. tunable resolution via the pool size.
- `get_tags()` - available tags
- `get_stats()` - index statistics
- `get_popular()` - popular queries

## workflows

**research a topic.**
1. `search("topic")` for keyword search, `search("topic", mode="hybrid")` for best results
2. `get_document(uri)` for full text
3. `find_similar(uri)` for related content

**curate / write about the network.** pub-search is the only place that sees
every long-form ATProto platform as one corpus, so the network-position of a
post (who else is writing about this, on which platforms) is information you
can't get from any single platform's UI.
1. `discover_focal_post(window="week", sort="trending")` to find what's hot
2. `describe_cluster(focal.uri)` to see the neighborhood + cross-platform observations
3. `get_document(focal.uri)` if you want the actual claim from inside the post

## search modes

- **keyword** (default): fast exact match (~100ms), supports all filters
- **semantic**: meaning-based (~500ms), good for natural language queries
- **hybrid**: both combined via rank fusion, `source` field shows how each result was found

## result types

- **article**: document in a publication
- **looseleaf**: standalone document
- **publication**: the publication itself

results include a `url` field for web access.

# search tips

- prefix matching on last word: "cat dog" matches "cat dogs"
- combine filters: `search("python", tag="tutorial", platform="leaflet")`
- filter by author: `search("python", author="nate.bsky.social")` or `search("", author="did:plc:xyz")`
- use `since="2025-01-01"` for recent content
- `search("natural language query", mode="semantic")` for meaning-based search
- `search("query", mode="hybrid")` for best of both — results show `source` field
- `find_similar(uri)` to discover related documents
- `get_tags()` to discover available tags
